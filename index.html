                Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from
                Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1]
                However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word
                animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a
                similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature
                segments and artstyles that can be considered as "anime".

                The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the
                1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large
                domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home
                media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese
                comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various
                broad and niche audiences.
